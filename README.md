# Tower-of-Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle game where the objective is to move a stack of disks from one rod to another by following the game rules. This Python implementation of the game uses the Pygame library to create the game screen and handle user input. The game starts with a menu screen where the player can select the difficulty level by using arrow keys. After selecting the difficulty, the player enters the game screen where he/she can move the disks from one rod to another by dragging them using the mouse. The game ends when the player successfully moves all the disks to the destination rod. At the end of the game, the player is shown the number of steps taken to complete the game and the minimum number of steps required to complete the game.
